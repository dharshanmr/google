		Chef - configuration management tool
	=============================================
# What is Chef / Configuration mgmnt tool applications, goals.
	- Chef is an automation platform that configures and
	  manages the infrastructure.
	  
	- Manually built infrastructure becomes hard to 
	  understand and modify. People tend to fear for 
	  implementing a change.
			  
	- Chef helps us to handle changes or change management
	  in a systematic fashion efficiently. so we can 
	  ensure that a system is configured in a correct and 
	  reliable manner.
	
	- When servers are build manually, it's not easy
	  to build them from scratch. Using Chef, Servers can 
	  be reproduced easily.

	- Enables infrastrucute as a code.
	
	- Chef can automatically detect the faults and repair 
	  them.
	  
ChefDK Installation:
===================
1. Download "Chef Development Kit" (Chefdk/CDK)
	chefdk_1.3.43-1_amd64.deb

2. Install the debian package using
	sudo dpkg -i chefdk_1.3.43-1_amd64.deb

3. Verify the installation
	$ chef --version

Chefdk uninstallation:
========================
dpkg --list | grep chefdk
sudo dpkg -P chefdk

Chef Syntax:
============
#
- By convention, files that contain chef code have the extension ".rb"
- The chef coding language is Ruby DSL. Ruby DSL is just a
	subset of Ruby.

- Using recipe, you just specify "WHAT" disired configuration need to be present in a machine; rather than "HOW" it should be accomplished.

Recipe Syntax:
===============
	resource 'NAME' do
	    parameter1  'value1'
	    attibute2   value2
	    property3   value3
	end

# Simplest form of Chef recipe code.

	file 'deployment.txt' do
	  content 'deployment is succusful!'
	  mode "755"
	end
	
	--> file - is called as a Resource. The file resource
		is used to manage a file on a computer. 
	--> deployment.txt - name_attribute/value for that resource.
	--> It can be a single quote or double.
	--> do - is a clause, denotes the start of a block.
	--> end - is closing pair for do.
	--> content - is called as attribute/parameter/property of "file" resource.
	--> indentation - two spaces.

What is Resource:
	Resources are building blocks used to define specific parts of infrastructure.
Resource defines actions for Chef to perform.

		
#
Chef Concept: Tell WHAT, Not HOW.
	
	Resources + Attributes = Recipe --> Chef:
				        WHAT do I care about?
						|
				        Decides HOW & Performs Actions


- Chef refers recipe and decides how to put the machine in
	desired configuration by reasoning about the current
	state of the system(i.e Idompotency).

	As opposed to shell/any scripting where we write 1000 of lines of code(HOW part), in Chef, you just specify "WHAT" not "HOW".


# Commonly used Chef resources
	- file
	- user
	- cron
	- directory
	- package
	- apt-update
	- template


# Roll back : Tell Chef what not to do.
	file "deployment.txt" do
	  action :delete
	end 

- :delete is called "symbol"

#
Chef in production environment:
================================
Chef Architecture:
	workstation
	chef server
	node
	knife
	chef-client
================
workstation: is the computer(typically your machine) where you write your cookbooks and administer your network.

Chef server: Central repository that contains the cookbooks you write and information about every node it manages.

Node: is a computer that is managed by a chef server. ex: computer in your QA/Prod environments.

Knife:  Knife command enables us to communicate with Chef 
		server from workstation.
		Knife is an interface between your workstation and 
		Chef server.
		Using knife, we can upload cookbooks to the server,
		and work with node.

Hosted Chef server setup:
============================
1. Sign up for hosted Chef (https://manage.chef.io/login)
2. Create an organization/Project	
	Go to Administration --> Organizations --> Create --> Project name.

Work station Setup:
======================
1. create a project directory "flipkart/.chef"

2. configure knife to talk to Chef server
	knife requires two files to talk to the Chef server
		1. username.pem (RSA private key ) 
		2. knife.rb (knife configuration file)
	
Generate these two files from 'hosted Chef server' and place them under "flipkart/.chef" directory to establish the connection between your workstation and the chef server.
	
How do you generate knife.rb & username.pem files from chef server?
	- Generate knife.rb: Administration--> click on organization-->generate knife config
	- Generate username.pem: Administration--> Users --> click on your Username --> "Reset key"

3. Validate Chef server conection from workstation:
	$ knife ssl check

4. Now you are ready to write cookbooks in your workstatin and upload the same to the server.

Write Cookbook:
=================
# Usually cookbooks goes into 'cookbooks' folder
$ mkdir wiculty1/cookbooks
$ cd wiculty1/cookbooks

#
Clone a sample cookbook from git hub.
$ git clone https://github.com/learn-chef/learn_chef_apache2.git

#
Upload your cookbook:
$ knife cookbook upload learn_chef_apache2

$ knife cookbook list


Bring up the Ubuntu "Node":
================================
1)
- Write a Dockerfile to create a docker node
	Take this Dockerfile from "Docker&Chef_Integration" folder

2)
- create docker image using
	$ docker build -t="nageshvkn/basic-node4chef" .

3)
- Create a node (container) from the above image using below command		
	$ docker run --name gamut -d -it nageshvkn/basic-node4chef /bin/bash


5)
Bootstrap the node:
- The bootstrap process connects workstation to your node over SSH.

knife bootstrap 172.17.0.2 --ssh-user gamut --ssh-password 'gamut' --sudo --use-sudo-password --node-name gamut --run-list 'recipe[learn_chef_apache2]'	 

- Bootstrap performs below steps:
	1. Installs chef-client in node.
	2. Associates the node to Chef server.
 	3. Downloads given cookbook from Chef servers and executes it.
       (i.e learn_chef_apache2).

To verify, run below commands..
	$ knife node list
 	$ knife node show gamut (view data about the node)

TESTING: "learn_chef_apache" Cookbook implementation In the node.
	http://172.17.0.2:80


#
Test your recipe locally before applying to PROD.
============================
	- Untested Chef code might make unintended configurational changes to your PROD / QA environments.
	- Most of the times, we want to deploy chef code to sandbox environments that closely simulate a prod environment.
	- It's not a good idea to run your experimental code directly in production before testing it in your sandbox env.

# ROLES:
- You can catergorize your machines logically using roles concept.
This role concept describes what cookbooks need to be executed in a node.

- Use Roles to implement a specific set of cookbooks that can be run in a specific set of machines.. for ex: Database machines, Web servers, Application servers..etc.

- Using Role, we define node's run-list.

- Run-list: List of recipes / cookbooks.



Creating Roles:
================
High level Notes:
 1 Create a role in your workstation
 2 Attach recipes/cookbooks to the Role
 3 Upload the Role to Chef server
 4 Attach node to the role
 5 Run chef-client in the node

#
Create roles directory:
$ mkdir nexamatic99/roles

#
Define roles using json format:
$ vim nexamatic99/roles/web.json

#
Upload Roles to chef server:
$ knife role from file roles/web.json

#
Check if Role is created on your Chef server:
$ knife role list

#
Check the Roles details / recepies attached to the role:
$ knife role show web	

#
Set run-list to our node / Set Role to our node / Attache the node to role
$ knife node run_list set gamut "role[web]" --> Add the node to a Role
$ knife node run_list remove gamut role[web] --> Remove the node from a Role

#
Check the run-list of our node:
$ knife node show gamut --run-list	

#
Login to the node and initialte "chef-run" manually.
$ chef-client

#
Creating Cookbooks:
====================
# Create a cookbook called 'nginx' in cookbooks directory
1. $ chef generate cookbook nginx

#
2. cd cookbooks/nginx

3. cd recipes; vim default.rb (write a recipe)

Recipe code:
---------------
execute "run apt-get update command" do
  command "apt-get update"
end

package "nginx" do
  action :install
end

cookbook_file "/var/www/html" do
  source "index.html"
end 

execute "this command will start nginx server" do
  command "service nginx start"
end
----------------	

4. Place our application code in below directory for deployment
	cd cookbooks/nginx/files
vim index.html
index.html code:
-----------------------
<html>
   <body>
     <h1 style="color:red;">Gamutkart Online Training Portal</h1>
</body> 
</html>
-----------------------

5. upload the cookbooks	
    knife cookbook upload nginx

9. Bootstrap the node with below command

$ knife bootstrap 172.17.0.2 --ssh-user gamut --ssh-password 'gamut' --sudo --use-sudo-password --node-name gamut

10. Create a ROLE (add role name, cookbook name in web.json roles configuration file) (Refer roles concept above)

10A.
Add 'gamut' node to the role using below command
$ knife node run_list set gamut role[web] 

11. Run below comamnd in the node for implementing the cookbook
$ sudo chef-client
	
12. Testing nginx cookbook implementation. If everything goes fine, nginx will be configured in the node and we can test our application deployed in the server by hitting the server. Run below in your browser..

	http://172.17.0.2:80

#
Running chef-client command from all servers:
- manuall
- use crontab
- use shell scripts

#
Deployments using Chef - Deploy gamutkart application using Chef
============================
# Server setup:
create an organization in chef server ( refer detailed explanation in above section 'Hosted Chef server setup')

# Workstation setup:
- create a project folder in your workstation ex: gamutkart

- create 'cookbooks' '.chef' and 'roles' directories under gamutkart project

- establish the connection between workstation and chef server (refer detailed explanation in above section 'Work station Setup')

# create cookbook for deployments:
- create cookbook in your workstation using '$ knife generate cookbook gamutkart2'
  write a recipe for deployments (In git notes, refer 'Gamut_Chef_HighLevel_Notes--> deployment_with_chef'-->cookbooks--> gamutkart2 --> recipes --> default.rb for the revipe file)
- build gamutkart2 application and copy gamutkart.war to "cookbooks/gamutkart2/files
- copy 'apache-tomcat-8.5.38.tar.gz' to "cookbooks/gamutkart2/files"
- upload the cookbook using 'knife cookbook upload gamutkart2'


# create role:
- create app-server.json in roles folder (In git notes, refer Gamut_Chef_HighLevel_Notes--> deployment_with_chef'--> roles for app-server.json)
- upload role using '$ knife role from file roles/app-server.json'

# create the node:
- create the node, bootstrap and attach the node to the role using below command
        $ docker run --name tomcat-server1 -it nageshvkn/basic-node4chef /bin/bash
        $ knife bootstrap 172.17.0.2 --ssh-user gamut --ssh-password 'gamut' --sudo --use-sudo-
        password --node-name tomcat-server1
        $ knife node run_list set tomcat-server1 "role[app-server]"

# perform Chef-run i.e run chef-client command in the node
        $ chef-run
- chef-client command should be able to talk to the server, download gamutkart2 cookbook and 
  execute it.

# Test Gamutkart application deployment in the node
- open the browser and type the url... http://172.17.0.2:8080/gamutkart

# Conclusion:
- So, using Chef cookbooks, we are able to configure gamutkart application hosting automatically.


CLEANUP:
======
# Delete the node from the Chef server
$ knife node delete gamut --yes

# Delete your cookbook from the Chef server
$ knife cookbook delete learn_chef_apache2 --all --yes

# Delete the role from the Chef server
$ knife role delete web --yes
