# Data Engineering on GCP Cheatsheet

This cheatsheet is currently a 9-page reference Data Engineering on the Google Cloud Platform. It covers the data engineering lifecycle, machine learning, Google case studies, and GCP's storage, compute, and big data products.

I compiled this sheet while studying for Google's Data Engineering Exam- this cheatsheet is not guaranteed to help you pass.
